### Project Description
This is a mobile app to help pavam teachers to measure the noise level and give the class a "Shush Score". It uses the phone's microphone to calculate the same. The quieter the class, the higher the score. For fun, there's a big button that plays a loud "shhhhh" sound that can be played any no. of times. Also an addo, all the classes in a school/ college can compete on a leaderboard, and lets see who wins the "Golden Shhuushh" trophy.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Isn't too much tiring for teachers to say "Shush" every single time when we make some behalam? And how much "Shush" we sahakarikaled for? HEADACHE ahnee 


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
App ind, picture abhi cool hei!


### Features
- **Real-time Noise Monitoring**: Uses device microphone to monitor ambient noise levels
- **Silence Scoring System**: Tracks and scores classroom quietness over time
- **Interactive Shush Button**: Play a "shush" sound effect to remind students to be quiet
- **Class Leaderboard**: Compare silence scores between different classes
- **Provider State Management**: Efficient state management using the Provider package
