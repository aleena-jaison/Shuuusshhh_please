### Project Description
You know how teacher says "Class, stay silent. It should be pin drop silence". And that is what we are aiming for !!

This is a mobile app to help pavam & strict teachers to measure the noise level and give the class a "Shush Score" with the ultimum being **"PIN DROP SILENCE**. It uses the phone's microphone to calculate the same. The quieter the class, the higher the score. For fun, there's a big button that plays a loud "shhhhh" sound that can be played any no. of times. Also an addo, all the classes in a school/ college can compete on a leaderboard, and lets see who wins the "Golden Shhuushh" trophy. 


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Isn't too much tiring for teachers to say "Shush", "Mindathirik pillere", "ithentha chanthayo" etc etc... every single time when we make some behalam? And how much "Shush" we sahakarikaled for? HEADACHE ahnee 


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
App ind, picture abhi cool hei!


### Features
- **Real-time Noise Monitoring**: Uses device microphone to monitor ambient noise levels
- **Silence Scoring System**: Tracks and scores classroom quietness over time
- **Interactive Shush Button**: Play a "shush" sound effect to remind students to be quiet
- **Class Leaderboard**: Compare silence scores between different classes
- **Upcoming Features** - Principal can directly send shush message through ‚òÅÔ∏è, Shush Automatio

  
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- `flutter`: SDK framework
- `provider`: State management
- `noise_meter`: Microphone noise level monitoring
- `audioplayers`: Audio playback for shush sound effects
- `permissions` : To maange the permission for microphone


### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android/iOS device or emulator with microphone access


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleena-jaison/Shuuusshhh_please.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

# Run
 ```bash
   flutter run
   ```


### Permissions
The app requires microphone permissions to monitor noise levels. Make sure to grant microphone access when prompted.



### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

Finally at the first stage this app is capable of detecting the noise and making the shush sound manually. In the next iteration It can be automated and devices like sensitive microphones will be used for "**PIN DROP SILENCE**
